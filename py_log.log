2024-09-19 22:50:48,250 INFO Работа добавлена: {'title': 'Low-Code Custom Application Developer', 'description': "TL;DR\nSeeking custom application developer to design and build an application by October 15 to support our events management processes.\n\nOur Company\nNASPA is the leading association for the advancement, health, and sustainability of the student affairs profession. We serve the diverse needs of our community, from vice presidents of student affairs to undergraduate student leaders considering a career in the field. Founded in 1919, NASPA includes more than 15,000 members in all 50 states, 29 countries, and 8 U.S. Territories. Guided by the principles of integrity, innovation, inclusion, and inquiry, we are dedicated to empowering our members to realize their full potential and to cultivating student success in collaboration with our institutional members, who represent every sector of higher education. NASPA centers justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in our work; read more about our commitment here.\n\nDescription\nWe are in need of a custom web application to streamline the process for organizing meetings and receptions during our events, especially the NASPA Annual Conference, which attracts around 6,000 attendees.\n\nThe application should enable meeting organizers to:\n1. Choose from standard audiovisual equipment options.\n2. Select catering packages based on the event’s time (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner) and venue (which may offer different menus).\n3. Specify quantities for each selection and receive a detailed breakdown of the associated costs (itemized pricing, taxes, additional fees, and a grand total).\n4. Review and adjust their selections before submitting the order for approval.\n\nAdditional features include:\n1. Reassigning order creation tasks to another contact if necessary.\n2. Display data that we already have about their meeting/reception, and give options for them to edit the data if needed.\n\nTechnical Considerations\n1. The ideal solution would utilize a low- or no-code application development platform such as Bubble,io, Webflow, GlideApps or similar, so that we could make small modifications or troubleshoot simple issues ourselves.\n2. We'd like to use Airtable as the source for data used in the application, though we'd be open to Google Sheets as an alternative - our average employee must be able to interact with the data, so it must be in one of those two applications\n3. Ideally the web application can include interactive pages with form inputs, as well as workflow automation; that said, we can use Workato iPaaS to handle workflow automation internally (we can build this if needed).\n4. The application should be optimized for desktop users - it’s unlikely that individuals will use mobile devices for this application.\n\nThis is a critical project, and while complex, successful completion could lead to further opportunities for custom applications within our organization. We value developers who can communicate well and are willing to collaborate with our team to ensure the application meets our needs.", 'price': 'Hourly: $40.00 - $100.00 ', 'link': '/jobs/Low-Code-Custom-Application-Developer_~021836827858259465134/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/'}
